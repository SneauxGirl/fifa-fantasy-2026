# Plan: Small Roster Edits to Align with Gameplay Revision

## Context

Upon test API call for specific data, undisclosed paywalls were discovered making 2026 data unavailable. 
New Gameplay will be turn-based rather than realtime with weekly reset, requiring a few updates to logic and scoring.

---

## Design

### 1. Type System

**File**: `/src/types/match.ts`

**Final model** (pool + role separation — **semantically distinct**, plus R16+ dynamics):
```typescript
type RosterPool = "available" | "unsigned" | "signed" | "eliminated"
type RosterRole = "starter" | "bench" | "eliminatedSigned" | null

// Pool: WHERE the member is in the pipeline
// Role: HOW they function (only meaningful when signed/eliminated)

// RosterSquad extends:
{
  pool: RosterPool;          // available | unsigned (staging) | signed (roster) | eliminated
  role: RosterRole;          // null (for available/unsigned) | "starter" (for signed) | "eliminatedSigned"
  isEliminated: boolean;     // Parallel flag: true if tournament-eliminated
}

// RosterPlayer extends:
{
  pool: RosterPool;          // available | unsigned | signed (roster) | eliminated
  role: RosterRole;          // null (for available/unsigned) | "starter" | "bench" | "eliminatedSigned"
  isEliminated: boolean;     // Parallel flag: true if tournament-eliminated
}

// Role mapping by pool (final):
// pool: "available"  → role: null (unselected, no role yet)
// pool: "unsigned"   → role: null (staging, awaiting sign confirmation)
// pool: "signed"     → role: "starter" (squads always; players in formation, scoring)
//                   OR role: "bench" (players in roster, not in formation, no scoring)
// pool: "eliminated" → role: "eliminatedSigned" (historical: was signed, then eliminated)
```

**Key principle**: Pool and Role are distinct. Pool describes membership state; Role describes function. Role is only meaningful for signed/eliminated pools.

---

### 2. Redux State
**File**: `/src/store/slices/rosterSlice.ts`

(filtered by pool property):
```typescript
players: {
  available: RosterPlayer[];        // pool: "available" (may have isEliminated: true)
  unsigned: RosterPlayer[];         // pool: "unsigned" (removed from available, not yet signed)
  signed: RosterPlayer[];           // pool: "signed" (in roster; role: "starter" | "bench")
  eliminated: RosterPlayer[];       // pool: "eliminated" (removed from signed; role: "eliminatedSigned")
}

squads: {
  available: RosterSquad[];         // pool: "available" (may have isEliminated: true)
  unsigned: RosterSquad[];          // pool: "unsigned" (staging bench, awaiting sign confirmation)
  signed: RosterSquad[];            // pool: "signed" (locked to roster; role: ALWAYS "starter", capped at 4)
  eliminated: RosterSquad[];        // pool: "eliminated" (removed from signed during tournament)
}
```
---

### 3. State Machine & Transitions

**State Machine Notes:**
- **role: null** — Member has no functional role (available/unsigned pools): unselected or awaiting sign confirmation. No visual badge.

- **role: "starter"** — Member is in starting formation and scoring (pool: signed only). Visual: ⚽ starter badge on card.
  - Squads: auto-assigned "starter" when signed (all 4 signed squads are starters)
  - Players: user-assigned when dragged to formation grid (max 11, max 1 GK, before QF lock)

- **role: "bench"** — Member is in roster but NOT in starting formation, no scoring (pool: signed only). Visual: no badge.

- **role: "eliminatedSigned"** — Member was signed, then eliminated during tournament (pool: eliminated only). Visual: "eliminatedSigned" badge for historical record.

- **Scoring multiplier**: If `substitute === true`, all points earned × 0.5 for entire tournament (new signings in substitute window only)

- Role is ONLY meaningful when pool is "signed" or "eliminated"; check pool first before checking role
- **Visual indicators**: ⚽ = "starter" (scoring), no badge = "bench" (no scoring)

**Lock States** (new):
- **Roster Lock** (activates at Quarterfinals "Play" click):
  - ❌ Cannot add/remove players from roster (pool changes frozen)
  - ❌ Cannot add/remove squads
  - ✅ CAN move players between bench ↔ starter (tactical flexibility remains)
  - Applies through Final

- **Minimum Requirements** (only before Roster Lock):
  - Before QF "Play": Must have 4 signed squads + 11 starters to proceed
  - After QF "Play": No minimums enforced (eliminations naturally degrade roster)

**Squad state machine**:
```

### 4. Reducer Actions

**File**: `/src/store/slices/rosterSlice.ts`

(13 reducers):
- **Squad transitions:**
  - `moveSquadToUnsigned` (available → unsigned, staging bench)
  - `moveSquadToAvailable` (unsigned → available, removal)
  - `moveSquadToSigned` (unsigned → signed with confirmation, auto-assigns role: "starter", validates 4-squad cap, also continues to display on the ROSTER with icon to denote starter)
  - `moveSquadToEliminated` (signed → eliminated, exclusive to Squad - Players have their own separate elimination logic)

- **Player transitions:**
  - `movePlayerToUnsigned` (available → unsigned, staging bench)
  - `movePlayerToAvailable` (unsigned → available, removal)
  - `movePlayerToSigned` (unsigned → signed, role: "bench" default, validates at <18, Goalkeeper cap at <3)
  - `movePlayerToStarter` (signed with role "bench" → signed with role "starter", validates <11 starters including up to <1 Goalkeeper but not required and no other position restrictions, also continues to display on the ROSTER with icon to denote starter)
  - `movePlayerToBench` (signed with role "starter" → signed with role "bench", starter icon removed)
  - `movePlayerToEliminated` (signed → eliminated, role becomes "eliminatedSigned", player National Team elimination data pulls exclusively, distinct from Squads)

- **Other:**
  - `initializeRoster` (respects isEliminated from JSON, initializes all pools, sets substitute flag for R16+ signings)
  - `setRoundLocked` (unchanged)
  - `validateSquadCapacity` (helper: checks if signed squad count < 4)
  - `calculateSubstitutePoints` (scoring: if substitute === true, multiply all earned points by 0.5)

### 5. Type

**Files**: **`/src/types/match.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   export type RosterPool = "available" | "unsigned" | "signed" | "eliminated";

                                          // - "starter" when pool: "signed" and scoring
                                          // - "eliminatedSigned" when pool: "eliminated"
     isEliminated: boolean;               // Parallel flag: true if tournament-eliminated

     coaches?: Coach[];
     officialRoster?: RosterPlayer[];
     squadGames?: Game[];                 // Games scheduled for this squad with isComplete flag
   }

   export interface RosterPlayer {
     type: "player";
     id: number;
     playerId: number;
     pool: RosterPool;                    // available | unsigned | signed (roster) | eliminated
     role: RosterRole;                    // Mapping:

                                          // - "starter" when pool: "signed", in formation, scoring
                                          // - "bench" when pool: "signed", in roster, no scoring
                                          // - "eliminatedSigned" when pool: "eliminated" (historical)

   ```

### 6. App.tsx Initialization

**File**: `/src/App.tsx`

**Keep as is for now - will need to be tweaked on adding database/initialize other than game start**

**Old structure** (respects isEliminated and pool from JSON):
```typescript
// Initialize Squads: all in "available" pool, respect isEliminated from JSON
const rosterSquads: RosterSquad[] = mockSquadsData.map((s: any) => ({
  type: "squad" as const,
  id: s.teamId,
  teamId: s.teamId,
  pool: "available" as const,
  role: null,                              // No functional role until signed
  isEliminated: s.status === "eliminated" ? true : false,  // ← Respect JSON
  name: s.name,
  code: s.code,
  flag: s.flag,
  matchPoints: {},
  coaches: s.coaches,
  officialRoster: s.officialRoster,
}));

// Initialize Players: all in "available" pool initially, respect isEliminated from JSON
// NOTE: Pre-eliminated players should NOT appear in available per user spec.
// If a player is pre-eliminated, initialize them in "eliminated" pool with role "eliminatedSigned"
const rosterPlayers: RosterPlayer[] = mockSquadsData.flatMap((s: any) =>
  (s.officialRoster || []).map((p: any) => ({
    type: "player" as const,
    id: p.id,
    playerId: p.id,
    pool: p.status === "eliminated" ? "eliminated" : "available" as const,
    role: p.status === "eliminated" ? "eliminatedSigned" : null,
    isEliminated: p.status === "eliminated" ? true : false,
    name: p.name,
    position: p.position,
    number: p.number,
    teamId: s.teamId,
    code: s.code,
    flag: s.flag,
    matchPoints: {},
  }))
);
```

### 8. Selector Updates

**File**: `/src/store/selectors/scoringSelectors.ts`

Update selectors to use new pool/role model:
```typescript
// ===== LOCK STATE SELECTOR =====
selectIsRosterLocked = (state) => state.roster.isRosterLocked
  // true when user clicks "Play" for Quarterfinals (roster locked through end)
  // false before QF Play click (roster editable)

// ===== SQUAD SELECTORS =====
selectAvailableSquads = squads.filter(s => s.pool === "available" && !s.isEliminated)  // role: null
selectEliminatedAvailableSquads = squads.filter(s => s.pool === "available" && s.isEliminated)  // role: null
selectUnsignedSquads = squads.filter(s => s.pool === "unsigned")  // role: null (staging)
selectSignedSquads = squads.filter(s => s.pool === "signed")  // All have role: "starter" (capped at 4)
selectEliminatedSquads = squads.filter(s => s.pool === "eliminated")  // role: "eliminatedSigned"
selectRemainingSquadSlots = 4 - selectSignedSquads.length

// ===== PLAYER SELECTORS =====
selectAvailablePlayers = players.filter(p => p.pool === "available" && !p.isEliminated)  // role: null
selectEliminatedAvailablePlayers = players.filter(p => p.pool === "available" && p.isEliminated)  // role: null
selectUnsignedPlayers = players.filter(p => p.pool === "unsigned")  // role: null (staging)
selectSignedPlayers = players.filter(p => p.pool === "signed")  // All roster members (role: "starter" or "bench")
selectStarterPlayers = players.filter(p => p.pool === "signed" && p.role === "starter")  // In formation
selectBenchPlayers = players.filter(p => p.pool === "signed" && p.role === "bench")  // In roster, not formation
selectEliminatedPlayers = players.filter(p => p.pool === "eliminated")  // role: "eliminatedSigned"
selectRemainingStarterSlots = 11 - selectStarterPlayers.length  // Useful before QF lock
selectRemainingRosterSlots = 18 - selectSignedPlayers.length

// ===== SCORING RULE =====
canScorePoints = (member: RosterSquad | RosterPlayer) => member.role === "starter"
  // Only starters score. Role: "starter" implies pool: "signed", so no need to check pool.
```

---

### 9. CRITICAL: Starters Formation Grid (Empty Slots)

**Before Quarterfinals Lock** (enforced 11-starter requirement):
```typescript
// StartersLineup should render fixed 11-slot grid:
const totalStarterSlots = 11;
const filledSlots = selectStarterPlayers;  // pool: "signed" && role: "starter"
const emptySlotCount = totalStarterSlots - filledSlots.length;

// Render all 11 positions:
{/* Filled slots with player cards (draggable out) */}
{filledSlots.map(player => <PlayerCard key={player.id} player={player} />)}

{/* Empty slots (draggable targets from bench) */}
{Array.from({ length: emptySlotCount }).map((_, idx) => (
  <EmptySlot key={`empty-${idx}`} onDropPlayer={movePlayerToStarter} />
))}
```

**After Quarterfinals Lock** (no minimum, grid adjusts dynamically):
```typescript
// StartersLineup shows only filled slots (no empty placeholders):
const filledSlots = selectStarterPlayers;  // pool: "signed" && role: "starter"

// Render only filled positions:
{filledSlots.map(player => <PlayerCard key={player.id} player={player} />)}

// Can still drag between bench ↔ starter, but no UI pressure to fill 11
```

**Why this matters**:
- **Early game (pre-QF)**: Fixed 11-slot grid gives visual feedback of formation completeness; users see what they need to fill
- **Late game (post-QF)**: Dynamic grid reflects reality of eliminations; users can see actual formation without "empty slot guilt"
- **Always**: Users can drag players between bench ↔ starter freely (no lock on formation adjustments)
- Drag-and-drop is intuitive: drop to empty slot (early game) or directly swap with bench player (late game)

---

### 10. Validation Rules

**File**: `/src/services/rosterService.ts`

Validation logic to match new pool/role state model:

```typescript
// ===== ROSTER LOCK STATE =====
isRosterLocked = false  // Set to true when user clicks "Play" for Quarterfinals
  // When true: no add/remove players or squads allowed
  // When true: can still move players between bench ↔ starter (tactical flexibility)

// ===== SQUAD VALIDATION =====
canAddSquadToUnsigned = (squad: RosterSquad) =>
  !squad.isEliminated &&
  squad.pool === "available" &&
  !isRosterLocked

canSignSquad = () => selectSignedSquads.length < 4 && !isRosterLocked

// Minimum requirement: only enforced before Quarterfinals
validateSignedSquadCount = () => {
  if (currentTurn < "Quarterfinals") {
    return selectSignedSquads.length === 4  // Required to play earlier rounds
  }
  return true  // No minimum after roster lock
}

// ===== PLAYER VALIDATION (ROSTER ADDITIONS) =====
// Only allowed when roster is NOT locked
canAddPlayerToRoster = (player: RosterPlayer) =>
  !player.isEliminated &&
  player.pool === "available" &&
  selectSignedPlayers.length < 18 &&
  (player.position !== "GK" || selectSignedPlayers.filter(p => p.position === "GK").length < 3) &&
  !isRosterLocked

canRemovePlayerFromRoster = (player: RosterPlayer) =>
  player.pool === "signed" &&
  !isRosterLocked

// ===== PLAYER VALIDATION (STARTER ADJUSTMENTS) =====
// NO LOCK required - players can adjust formation through entire tournament
canPromoteToStarter = (player: RosterPlayer) => {
  // Before QF: enforce 11-starter limit
  if (currentTurn < "Quarterfinals") {
    return selectStarterPlayers.length < 11 &&
           (player.position !== "GK" || selectStarterPlayers.filter(p => p.position === "GK").length < 1)
  }
  // After QF: no limits, just fill available slots
  return player.pool === "signed" && player.role === "bench"
}

canPromoveToBench = (player: RosterPlayer) =>
  player.pool === "signed" && player.role === "starter"
  // Always allowed, no lock

// ===== ROSTER COMPOSITION VALIDATION =====
validateRosterCount = () => {
  if (currentTurn < "Quarterfinals") {
    return selectSignedPlayers.length >= 11 && selectSignedPlayers.length <= 18
  }
  return true  // No limits after roster lock
}

validateRosterPositions = () => {
  const gkCount = selectSignedPlayers.filter(p => p.position === "GK").length
  return gkCount <= 3  // Max 3 GK, no GK requirement
}

// ===== STARTER COMPOSITION VALIDATION =====
validateStarterCount = () => {
  if (currentTurn < "Quarterfinals") {
    return selectStarterPlayers.length === 11  // Required to start tournament
  }
  return true  // No minimum after roster lock (naturally degraded by eliminations)
}

validateStarterPositions = () => {
  const gkCount = selectStarterPlayers.filter(p => p.position === "GK").length
  return gkCount <= 1  // Max 1 GK in starters, GK not required
}

// ===== ELIMINATION LOGIC =====
// Squad elimination: exclusive to squads (separate from player elimination)
// Triggered when National Team is eliminated
canEliminateSquad = (squad: RosterSquad) => squad.pool === "signed" && squad.isEliminated === false
moveSquadToEliminated = (squad: RosterSquad) => {
  // Updates squad.pool to "eliminated" and role to "eliminatedSigned"
  // Does NOT automatically eliminate players on that squad
  // Triggered by National Team elimination, independent of Player elimination
}

// Player elimination: based on national team status
// Triggered when National Team is eliminated OR player has individual incident (red card, injury)
canEliminatePlayer = (player: RosterPlayer) =>

## 11. Turn Completion Async Thunk (Phase 3 API Integration)

**File**: `/src/store/thunks/rosterThunks.ts` (new) or `/src/store/slices/rosterSlice.ts`

**Purpose**: When user clicks "Play", execute turn completion sequence in strict order:
1. Fetch match results from API
2. Update all scores (Scoring Record displayed first)
3. Lock turn scores
4. Update eliminated status (cascade from National Team)
5. Show elimination popup
6. Move eliminated members to eliminated pool

**Implementation** (async thunk with redux-thunk):

```typescript
export const playTurn = (turnId: string) => async (dispatch, getState) => {
  try {
    // Step 0: Fetch match results from API (happens first, outside Redux)
    const matchResults = await matchService.getMatchResults(turnId);

    // Step 1: Update all scores (Scoring Record component displays immediately)
    dispatch(updateScores(matchResults));

    // Step 2: Lock turn scores (points are now final for this turn)
    dispatch(lockTurnScores(turnId));

    // Step 3: Update eliminated status based on National Team eliminations
    // - Cascade: National Team eliminated → Squad marked eliminated
    // - Cascade: National Team eliminated → All its Players marked eliminated
    // - Independent: Individual Player incidents (red card, injury) mark that Player eliminated
    dispatch(updateEliminationStatus(matchResults));

    // Step 4: Show elimination popup with squads and players eliminated this turn
    const eliminatedThisTurn = getState().roster.justEliminated;
    if (eliminatedThisTurn.squads.length > 0 || eliminatedThisTurn.players.length > 0) {
      dispatch(showEliminationModal(eliminatedThisTurn));
    }

    // Step 5: Move all eliminated members to eliminated pool
    dispatch(moveEliminatedToPool());

    // Step 6: Advance turn counter (ready for roster edits before next Play click)
    dispatch(advanceTurn());

  } catch (error) {
    dispatch(handlePlayTurnError(error));
  }
}
```

**User Experience Flow**:
1. User clicks "Play" button
2. Loading state shown (API call in progress)
3. API returns results
4. Scoring Record updates immediately (Step 1)
5. Points locked (Step 2)
6. Elimination status calculated (Step 3)
7. Popup shows who was eliminated (Step 4 - user must acknowledge)
8. Eliminated members moved out of roster (Step 5)
9. Turn advances, user can now edit roster for next turn

**Critical Ordering Notes**:
- Step 1 (updateScores) must be first so Scoring Record displays immediately
- Step 2 (lockScores) must be before Step 3 so points don't change during elimination processing
- Step 3 (updateEliminationStatus) must be before Step 4 so modal knows who to show
- Step 4 (showEliminationModal) may require user acknowledgment before Step 5 (x to close)
- Step 5 (moveToEliminated) must happen after modal dismissed to avoid UI thrashing

## 12. Database Persistence & Game State Restoration (Phase 4+)

**Context**: Currently, game state initializes fresh from `squads.json` and `players.json` on every load. When Phase 4 (Auth/Database) is implemented, the app will need to restore saved game state mid-tournament.

### Game State to Persist

When a user saves/closes a game, the following must be stored in the database:

**Roster State**:
- All players: `pool`, `role`, `isEliminated`, `substitute`, `matchPoints`, `totalPoints`
- All squads: `pool`, `role`, `isEliminated`, `substitute`, `matchPoints`, `totalPoints`
- Current roster counts (signed, starters, bench, eliminated)
- `isRosterLocked` flag (true if QF "Play" has been clicked)

**Tournament State**:
- Current round/turn (e.g., "Group Stage 1", "R16", "Quarterfinals")
- Current week/day within turn (if sub-turn granularity needed)
- List of matches played (marked `isComplete`)
- List of matches remaining

**Scoring State**:
- Cumulative points per turn (turn-by-turn breakdown)
- Running total (all turns combined)
- Individual match points by player/squad
- Scoring Record history (all completed turns)

**UI State** (optional but helpful):
- Sidebar visibility toggle state
- Current page/view (Dashboard, Roster, FutureMatches)
- Modal state if interrupted mid-action

### Initialization on Reload (Future)

When a user returns to a saved game:

1. **Load user data** from database (not JSON)
2. **Restore all pools** with correct `pool` and `role` values
3. **Restore elimination status** (`isEliminated` for squads/players/individuals)
4. **Restore scoring** (all `matchPoints`, `totalPoints`, `substitute` flags)
5. **Restore lock state** (`isRosterLocked` flag)
6. **Resume from last turn** (show Dashboard for current turn, not Group Stage 1)
7. **Preserve match history** (Finished matches remain visible)

### Key Differences from Fresh Init

| Aspect | Fresh Init (Current) | Resumed Game (Future) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Data source | `squads.json`, `players.json` | Database (user doc) |
| Elimination status | From JSON `status` field | From saved `isEliminated` flag |
| Player pool | All available (except pre-eliminated) | Restore exact pool/role state |
| Squad pool | All available | Restore exact pool/role state |
| Scoring | Empty (`matchPoints: {}`) | Restore all historical points |
| Tournament round | Always Group Stage 1 | Resume from saved round |
| Roster assignments | None (user starts fresh) | Restore exact selections + lock state |
| Formation | None (empty grid) | Restore starters/bench assignments |

### Implementation Notes for Phase 4

- **Do NOT modify current App.tsx initialization** — keep JSON-based init for local games / dev
- **Create separate initialization flow** for database-loaded games:
  - `initializeFromJSON()` (current) — for fresh games
  - `initializeFromDatabase()` (new) — for resumed games
- **Use Redux dispatch** to populate store from database snapshot
- **Validate persisted state before restoring**:
  - Check pool/role transitions are valid
  - Verify no data corruption
  - Ensure isRosterLocked makes sense with current turn
- **Handle version migration** — if game logic changes between sessions, may need to re-normalize old saves
- **Determine storage key** — use userId + gameId or similar to support multiple games per user

### Critical for Phase 4: isRosterLocked Persistence

- `isRosterLocked` must be persisted in database
- On reload, if `isRosterLocked === true`:
  - Disable all "add/remove" buttons in roster UI
  - Enable all "move to starter/bench" buttons
  - Update StartersLineup grid style to dynamic (filled slots only)
- If `isRosterLocked === false`:
  - All roster edit buttons enabled
  - StartersLineup grid shows 11 fixed slots with empty placeholders
