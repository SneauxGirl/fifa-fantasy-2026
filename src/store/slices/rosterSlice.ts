/**
 * New Roster Model (Pool + Role Separation):
 *
 * Pool describes WHERE a member is:
 * - "available": Not selected (in tournament, awaiting selection)
 * - "unsigned": Dragged to staging, awaiting sign confirmation
 * - "signed": Locked to roster for tournament
 * - "eliminated": Was signed, now tournament-eliminated
 *
 * Role describes WHAT FUNCTION the member performs (only meaningful when pool === "signed" or "eliminated"):
 * - null: No role yet (pool: "available" or "unsigned")
 * - "starter": In formation, scoring actively
 * - "bench": In roster, not in formation, no scoring
 * - "eliminatedSigned": Was starter/bench, now tournament-eliminated
 *
 * Additional flags:
 * - isEliminated: Tournament elimination status (independent of pool)
 * - substitute: Signed during R16? Scores at 50% for entire tournament
 * - playerGames/squadGames: Scheduled games with isComplete flag
